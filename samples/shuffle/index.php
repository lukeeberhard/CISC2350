					<!-- link directs to the individual list page, with its list items -->
					<a href="list.php?id=<?php echo $list['id']; ?>"><?php echo $list['name']; ?></a>
					<!--
						notice the "?id=" part of the url.  This construct is called the "query string"
						of the url.  The query string is used to pass information to a page via the
						GET request/method.

						http://localhost:8888/list.php?id=2

						$_GET['id'] => 2

						everything that comes after a "?" in the url is part of the query string.  The query string
						works by having a key/value system for its parameters.  The "key" is assigned a value as follows:

							key=some_value

						There should be no spaces in the keys or values, since they need to be valid urls.  To have several key/value pairs in your query string, delimit them with the "&" character:

							key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3

						can be considered as:

							key1 => value1&
							key2 => value2&
							key3 => value3

							$_GET['key1'] => value1
						The query values in your url query string can be accessed as the $_GET variable (Like $_POST).
					-->
				</td>
				<td>
					<a href="delete_list.php?id=<?php echo $list['id']; ?>">delete</a>
					<!--
						this query string would be something like:
							localhost/delete_list.php?id=9

						With the "id" value of 9 available in the $_GET associative array when
						delete_list.php is loaded
					-->
